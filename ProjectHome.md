Comet Desktop is an open source web desktop

Comet Desktop's goal is to be a web desktop that everyone can use, and an application framework that will allow developers to build anything they can dream of.

One major difference is that Comet Desktop's back-end has been rewritten entirely in **Perl**.

**Note**

The entire Comet Desktop backend is being rewritten to work on top of [Mojolicious](http://mojolicious.org/)!
